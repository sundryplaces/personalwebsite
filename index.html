	<h1> In sundry places </h1>
	<p> A digital garden comprised of thoughts, sounds, and snapshots from a blessed life in troubled times. </p>
	<p>Professionally I’m a junior high science, math, and career and technology teacher. I work in alternative education and my assignment includes managing the school makerspace and facilitating youth social innovation labs for other schools. I explore these things in my garden, but, in general, I'm the work-to-live type.</p>
	<p> When I’m living, I’m making/fixing stuff, creating sounds, enjoying the outdoors, connecting with my people, trying to find God's light in everything, eating good vegetarian food, and enjoying simple domesticity with my beautiful partner.</p>
	<p>This is a garden, not a polished blog. It's written for me, but you're welcome to see. Everything found here is a fraction of baked, open to discussion, and subject to growth.</p>
	<p>Here are some of the topics I’m interested in:</p>
		<li> Music / sound </li>
		<li> Making </li>
		<li> Repairing </li>
		<li> Faith </li>
		<li> Nature </li>
		<li> Post-humanism </li>
		<li> Social innovation </li>
		<li> Pedagogy </li>
